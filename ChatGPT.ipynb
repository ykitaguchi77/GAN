However, several factors make difficult to access medical care. For instance, physical disability, physiological problems, old age, distance, limited medical expertise in rural areas, climate conditions and employment. Also, long diagnosing time and high cost can discourage people from receiving dermatological care.The increasing availability and easy to use of smartphone applications has allowed significant growth of smartphones. Various smartphone applications have been introduced in different areas of medicine. They are becoming important particularly in dermatology since dermatological diseases are usually visible by human eyes and diagnosis is mainly based on visual screening of the lesions and pattern recognition. Therefore, patients can have active roles in their health-management using these applications. However, is it possible to diagnose skin diseases automatically with the advancements in mobile technologies and deep learning-based methodologies? To answer this question, in this paper, recent smartphone applications have been reviewed.'\n",

            " Corneal diseases are a major public health concern, and early diagnosis is essential for successful treatment. Delayed diagnosis can lead to severe complications, including vision loss and even blindness. Factors such as physical disability, physiological problems, old age, distance, limited medical expertise in rural areas, climate conditions, and employment can make access to medical care difficult. Additionally, long diagnosing times and high costs can discourage people from receiving ophthalmological care. Therefore, it is important to develop new methods for the early and accurate diagnosis of corneal diseases. \n",
